# Core
streamlit==1.36.0
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4         # pin <2.0; many ML wheels still rely on 1.x ABI
scipy==1.11.4
joblib==1.3.2
scikit-learn==1.4.2

# Boosted trees / stacks
xgboost==1.7.6        # stable wheels for linux x86_64 py3.10/3.11
lightgbm==3.3.5       # safe wheel; 4.x is OK too but 3.3.5 builds fastest
catboost==1.2.5       # has manylinux wheels; works with numpy 1.26.*

# Misc (often pulled implicitly, but pinning avoids protobuf/tornado issues)
